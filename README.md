# 2024-prelim-material

This repository contains the 2024 A-Level AQA Computer Science Preliminary Material - the .py file has been editted (summary comments have been added) but all functionality works as it should.
Use this to revise for the A-Level exam - or don't. I do not care. You can download the code or you can simply copy and paste it directly into a code editor of your choosing.
